<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<p1>
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be<br>
Call it quits<br>
Call it destiny<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try<br>
<br>
We had a good thing going lately<br>
Might not have always been a fairy tale<br>
But you know and I know<br>
That they ain't real<br>
I'll take the truth over the story<br>
<br>
You might have tried my patience lately<br>
But I'm not about to let us fail<br>
I'll be the wind picking up your sail<br>
But won't you do something for me?<br>
<br>
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be<br>
Call it quits<br>
Call it destiny<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try<br>
<br>
Coming and going<br>
Inside out<br>
Back to front<br>
Oh, tangled and messy<br>
That's how we've been and we'll always be<br>
And that's alright with me<br>
<br>
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be<br>
Call it quits<br>
Call it destiny<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try<br>
<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try<br>
Just because it won't come easily<br>
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try<br>
</p1>
